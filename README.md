## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**MaymnKhin/MaymnKhin** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

<p>Fresh CS grad who loves building cool stuff with code! I'm all about software engineering - from crafting slick web apps to diving into the backend magic. Java's my go-to, but I'm pretty flexible with whatever gets the job done. Thanks to my Big Data background, I can wrangle massive datasets and extract the insights that matter. I've even dipped into the AI world, training NLP models and making them actually useful. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new tech frameworks or thinking about how to make systems more efficient. Always down to collaborate on interesting projects, so hit me up if you want to build something awesome together!<p>
