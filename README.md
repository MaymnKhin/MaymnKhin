<p>I'm a software engineer with a fresh Computer Science degree specializing in Big Data. I build full-stack applications and train AI models that solve real problems. Java's my go-to language, but I'm pretty flexible with whatever gets the job done. Thanks to my Big Data background, I can wrangle massive datasets and extract the insights that matter. I've even dipped into the AI world, training NLP models and making them actually useful. Currently working on projects that blend traditional software engineering with modern AI approaches.<p>
